JavaScript is a versatile and widely used programming language that is primarily known for its role in web development. It allows developers to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites, making them more engaging and user-friendly. JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, meaning it runs on the user's web browser, enabling real-time interactions without the need to communicate with the server for every action.

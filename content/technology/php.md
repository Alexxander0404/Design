PHP, which stands for Hypertext Preprocessor, is a server-side scripting language widely used for web development. It is embedded within HTML code and processed on the server, generating dynamic web pages. PHP is especially well-suited for building websites and web applications that interact with databases, handle user authentication, and perform various server-side tasks.

<p>
SQLite is a software library that provides a relational database management system (RDBMS). Unlike most traditional RDBMS systems, SQLite is serverless and self-contained, meaning it doesn't require a separate server process and operates as a library linked directly to the application that uses it. It is a lightweight and embedded database engine, making it suitable for a variety of applications and devices.
